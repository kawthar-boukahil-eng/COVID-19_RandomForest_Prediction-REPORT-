# Prediction of COVID-19 Confirmed Cases and Deaths using Random Forest Regressor

## Abstract:
This project explores the prediction of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths using the Random Forest Regressor model. We utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to analyze the data and generate predictions. Statistical analysis and visualizations, including heatmaps, bar plots, and line plots, helped to present the findings. The results demonstrate a good prediction accuracy based on several evaluation metrics.
